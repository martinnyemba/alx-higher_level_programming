# Project: 0x09 Python - Everything is object

## Background Context

Now that we understand that everything is an object and have a little bit of knowledge, let�~@~Ys pause and look a little bit closer at how Python works with different types of objects.

This project is a little bit different than the usual projects. The first part is only questions about Python�~@~Ys specificity like �~@~\What would be the result of�~@��~@~]. You should read all documentation first, then take the time to think and brainstorm with your peers about what you think and why. Try to do this without coding anything for a few hours.

It�~@~Ys important that you truly understand the reasons behind the answers of all those tasks so that you can apply the same logic to other variables and other variable types.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

- Why Python programming is awesome
- What is an object
- What is the difference between a class and an object or instance
- What is the difference between an immutable object and a mutable object
- What is a reference
- What is an assignment
- What is an alias
- How to know if two variables are identical
- How to know if two variables are linked to the same object
- How to display the variable identifier (which is the memory address in the CPython implementation)
- What are mutable and immutable
- What are the built-in mutable types
- What are the built-in immutable types
- How does Python pass variables to functions

## Requirements

- **Executability**: All your files must be executable
- **File Length**: The length of your files will be tested using wc
- **Code Style**: Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
- **Documentation**: A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory

### .txt Answer Files
