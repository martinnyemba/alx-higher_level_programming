# Python Classes and Objects

## Introduction
Welcome to the Python Classes and Objects project! In this project, you'll embark on a journey into the world of object-oriented programming (OOP) with Python. Object-oriented programming is a powerful paradigm that allows you to model real-world entities as objects, each with its own attributes and behaviors.

Throughout this project, you'll learn about the fundamental concepts of OOP, such as classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism. You'll explore how to create classes and instantiate objects, define attributes and methods, and leverage advanced OOP features to build robust and maintainable Python code.

By completing the tasks in this project, you'll not only deepen your understanding of Python's OOP capabilities but also sharpen your problem-solving skills and enhance your ability to design and implement elegant software solutions.

So, let's dive in and discover the power and versatility of Python's object-oriented programming features!


## Background Context
Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a fundamental paradigm in software development, allowing for better organization, reusability, and maintainability of code. This project serves as an introduction to OOP in Python, covering essential concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.

## Resources
To ensure a comprehensive understanding of OOP in Python, it's crucial to review the following resources:
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Object Oriented Programming (Please be careful:...)
- Properties vs. Getters and Setters
- Learn to Program 9 : Object Oriented Programming
- Python Classes and Objects
- Object Oriented Programming

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- All your files should end with a new line
The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
All your files must be executable
The length of your files will be tested using wc
- All your modules should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
- All your classes should have a documentation '''(python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')'''
- All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')
- A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)

## Learning Objectives
By completing this project, you'll achieve the following learning objectives:
- Understand the principles of OOP and its advantages in Python programming.
- Define and utilize classes and objects to model real-world entities effectively.
- Differentiate between class attributes, instance attributes, and methods.
- Implement encapsulation, data abstraction, and information hiding for better code organization.
- Utilize inheritance and polymorphism to create hierarchies of classes with shared functionality.
- Write clear and concise documentation for classes and methods to enhance code readability and maintainability.

## Tasks Overview
The project consists of several tasks, each designed to reinforce specific concepts of OOP in Python:

1. **My first square:** Define an empty class `Square` as the starting point for exploring class creation and instance attributes.

2. **Square with size:** Create a class `Square` with a private instance attribute `size` and instantiation with size.

3. **Size validation:** Add validation to the `size` attribute to ensure it's an integer and greater than or equal to 0.

4. **Area of a square:** Implement a method to calculate the area of a square based on its size.

5. **Access and update private attribute:** Define getter and setter methods for the `size` attribute to control access and ensure data integrity.

6. **Printing a square:** Add a method to print a square using the `#` character, with the size specified by the `size` attribute.

7. **Coordinates of a square:** Extend the `Square` class to support position coordinates, allowing for more flexible printing of squares.

8. **Singly linked list:** Implement a singly linked list data structure using classes to understand node manipulation and list traversal.

9. **Compare 2 squares:** Overload comparison operators for the `Square` class based on the area of squares to facilitate comparisons.

10. **ByteCode -> Python #5:** Write a Python class that replicates the behavior of a given Python bytecode, demonstrating an understanding of bytecode and its relationship with Python classes.
